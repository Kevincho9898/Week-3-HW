1.) 'Function draw' draws the blades of grass

2.  if (random() > 0.999) {
    fill(255);
    rect(0, 0, width, height-15);
    h = 10;
  }
  The lawan mower comes if the grass has grown over 0.999
  
  3.)The h variable determines the height of the grass grown
  
  4.)height-10 sets the placement for the grass and the ground, and 'height-10-random(h)' set the maximumn height of the grass
